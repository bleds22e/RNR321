# Exploring Other Distance-Sampling Methods

As usual, having the PowerPoint slides open (Lecture 23) as you work through this exercise will be helpful! As will the example from lab, `Module5_Lab2_key.R`

Load the `tidyverse`
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Point-Centered Quarter

1. Read in the data. This is data for saguaros > 2m tall.
```{r}
saguaro <- read_csv("data_raw/PCQ_Data.csv")
```

2. Check out the data frame. How many points (`k`) were sampled? How many distances did we measure at each point (`n`)? (2 pts)
```{r}
head(saguaro)
k <- 8
n <- 4
```


3. Take a look at the equation for estimating density using the PCQ method. The numerator of the equation can be calculated in one step! Calculate the numerator using the objects you created in the question above.
```{r}
numerator <- k * n
```

The denominator is a bit more complicated, but we can work through it together.
Bear with me while we do some data wrangling to make it easier to calculate!

Right now, the distance measurements are in 4 different columns. Let's first
use a function from the tidyverse to put all the distance measurements into 
one column.
```{r}
saguaro_long <- pivot_longer(data = saguaro,
                             cols = NE:NW,            # which columns to include in our "pivot"
                             names_to = "Quarter",    # what to name the column with the previous column names
                             values_to = "Distance")  # what to name the new column with the values that were in the previous columns
head(saguaro_long)  # all the distance values are now in one column, 
                    # and there is a new column that has the name of the quarter, which were previously column names
```

4. Now, we need to square all of these values. Fill in the correct column name below and run the code.
```{r}
squared_distances <- saguaro_long %>% 
  mutate(Distance_squared = Distance ^ 2) 
head(squared_distances)
```

5. We now sum the squared distances. Fill in the correct column name below and run the code.
```{r}
sum_sqrd_distances <- squared_distances %>% 
  summarise(Sum_Squared_Distances = sum(Distance_squared))
head(sum_sqrd_distances)
```

6. We can calculate the value of the denominator by multiple the sum of the squared distances (`sum_sqrd_distances`) by pi (you can type `pi` into the equation)
```{r}
denominator <- sum_sqrd_distances * pi
```

7. Finally, we can calculate our density estimate (# saguaros per square meter)
```{r}
density <- numerator / denominator
print(density)
```

8. Convert the density estimate to # saguaros per hectare (ha = 100m x 100m AKA 10,000 m2)
```{r}
density_ha <- density * 10000
density_ha
```

9. Based on the target of these surveys (saguaros > 2m) and what you know about
the assumptions of PCQ methods, do you think this estimate of density is 
a reliable estimate? Why or why not? (2 pts)

## Spatial Patterns 

### Plot-Based Estimates

The script that we used in lab today will be very helpful!

Below are some data from Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) seedlings were counted on 104 10 x 10 cm plots.
```{r}
seedlings <- c(0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 7, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 6, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 8, 
               0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 6, 5, 2, 0, 0, 
               0, 1, 3, 8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 6, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 7, 4, 2, 0, 
               1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 6, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 6, 7, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 7, 4) 
table(seedlings)
```

10. Create a histogram of the data (because this data is in vector form rather than
a data frame, we do not need to specify a column like we have in the past).
```{r}
hist(seedlings)
```

11. From what we've talked about in class, hypothesize which pattern of dispersion
these data are likely to show: clumped, random, or uniform. Why? (2 pts)
Hint: think about the mean and the variance.

  _Answer:_

12. Use the mean function to calculate the mean number of seedlings per plots.
```{r}
mean_seedlings <- mean(seedlings)
```


13. Use `var()` to calculate the variance around the mean.
```{r}
var_seedlings <- var(seedlings)
```


14. Calculate the Index of Dispersion (ID) to characterize the dispersion pattern.
Which pattern does the ID value indicate? (2 pts)
```{r}
ID <- var_seedlings / mean_seedlings
ID
```

  _Answer:_
  
We aren't done yet, though! We need to test the significance of our findings.

15. First, create the chi.sq test statistic.
```{r}
df <- (length(seedlings) - 1) 
chi.sq <- ID * df
chi.sq
```

16. Based on the fact that our n is > 100, we will want to use the normal distribution.
That means we first need to calculate our test statistic.
```{r}
d <- sqrt(2 * chi.sq) - sqrt((2 * df) - 1)
```


17. Run the correct significance test. 
```{r}
pnorm(d, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

18. Is the pattern significantly different from random? 
Remember, the way we've coded this means our interpretation differs a bit from the PowerPoint slides.
If the P-value is smaller than 0.10, then we reject the null hypothesis and say that the pattern differs significantly from random.

  _Answer:_

19. Think critically about what the variance of sample data means. In your own
words, explain why you would expect the variance for a species with a uniform
distribution to be smaller than the variance for a species with a clumped 
distribution? (2 pts)
