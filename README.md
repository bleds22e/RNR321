# RNR321
R scripts and RMarkdown files for RNR 321 labs and assignments.

All assignments and labs can be found in the `scripts` folder. Naming conventions (a bit confusing...) are detailed below.

_Example: Materials for the first lab of Module 3_

_Provided to Students:_
* Module3_Lab1.Rmd -- file with code chunks empty for students to fill in as I live code an example of what will be covered in the assignment 
* Module3_Assignment1.Rmd -- file with code chunks (and answers) empty for students to fill in and complete the assignment
* Module3_Assignment1_AnswerKey.pdf -- PDF document with the expected outputs from code chunks in the assignment; the code creating the outputs is not visible

_NOT Provided to Students:_
* Module3_Lab1_key.Rmd -- file with code chunks filled in which I reference as I live code
* Module3_Assignment1_key.Rmd -- file with code chunks and answers filled in; used by TAs and me for grading
* Module3_Assignment1_key.pdf -- PDF version of the RMarkdown file with code chunks and answers filled in
* Module3_Assignment1_AnswerKey.Rmd -- the code which is used to create the PDF provided to students with the expected outputs from code chunks. Code is not visible in the PDF document by setting `echo = FALSE`.
